# Revert Filters Extension

This extension enables you to add a button directly into your dashboard that resets to certain filter settings. Great for embedded dashboards that do not have the toolbar showing or for a more intuitive interface.

## Using the Extension
1. Set your dashboard filters they way you want to be able to revert to.
2. Open the configuration window and click "Save Settings".
3. Optional: Customize your buttons label and colors.
